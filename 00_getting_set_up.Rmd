# Getting Set Up

We need the latest versions of these R packages installed from GitHub. 

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github('ropensci/bowerbird')
```

This workshop includes a pre-bundled data set using the `piggyback` GitHub releases mechanism. The bowerbird package will happily build this project from scratch from
the original data providers, but it takes longer than we have for this workshop. 

```{r pigback, eval = FALSE}
piggyback::get_em()
```
